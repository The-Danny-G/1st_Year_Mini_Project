# Cohen 2015 Example

Here I have included my initial code attempting to replicate the results MaBoSS and GINsim on the basic model as used in 'Mathematical Modelling of Molecular Pathways Enabling Tumour Cell Invasion and Migration (2015)' by Cohen et. al.

Here you can find the model representation using the GINsim visualisation. This was then exported to BoolNet format (.bnet) to be imported into R. I also exported to MaBoSS format, using a .cfg and .bnd file. My code and results can be found in 'Initial_Code.Rmd', whilst the results of MaBoSS can be seen in the .csv file. The results from GINsim's inbuilt stable state finder were the same as the MaBoSS results.
